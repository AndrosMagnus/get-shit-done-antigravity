# GSD Style (Antigravity)

- Tone: imperative, concise, technical. Avoid filler and sycophancy.
- Structure plans with XML tags: `<objective>`, `<task>`, `<action>`, `<verify>`, `<done>`.
- Every task includes measurable verification (`<verify>`) and success criteria (`<done>`).
- Keep wave/dependency frontmatter for parallel execution.
- Prefer explicit file paths, commands, and expected outputs.
